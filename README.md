DSA Repository
Welcome to the DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Repository! This is a dedicated platform where I am sharing various problems and solutions I encounter while actively learning and exploring DSA. The solutions to these problems are implemented primarily in Java.

This repository serves as a reflective learning diary, tracking progress and serving as a practical resource for anyone looking to delve into the world of DSA.

Repository Structure
The repository is divided into two main branches:

Master Branch: This branch includes problems that I come across during my learning journey along with their solutions.

Assignment Branch: This branch is essentially for posting assignment questions. That way, the Master and Assignment branches remain segregated for efficient navigation.

Learning
The Java language is used for all problem-solving in this repository as it's one of the most popular languages for handling DSA related problems and has been my language of choice throughout this learning journey.

Contribution
While this repository is primarily for personal learning, I am always open to collaboration. I believe in the power of shared knowledge and community learning. Feel free to fork this repository, provide suggestions, optimize solutions or add new problems to it.

Remember, every question has numerous possible answers, and there's always something to learn from each other. Happy Coding! ðŸš€
